  "description": "The motivation behind this project was to solidify my knowledge of DOM manipulation and web API's. I was to build a code quiz using the knowledge I have regarding DOM manipulation and Javascript. Additionaly, this challenge introduced me to concepts regarding API's. I also learned about the importance of working on a project in stages. I tried using pen and paper to write the steps and basic mock up of my project. This way, I was able to visualize the end product and ensure it was responsive and organized. Finally, I was able to finally understand the window object and its importance in web development.",
