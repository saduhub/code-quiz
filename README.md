## Description

This project is a code quiz that makes use of TypeScript and jQuery. The motivation behind building this project was to demonstrate proficiency in working with TypeScript and jQuery. By creating this code quiz, I aimed to showcase my skills in designing and implementing an application that offers the ability to take a quiz on JavaScript. It also sets the foundation for a web application that will allow a user to access hundreds of questions from Trivia databases.

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into the following areas:
  
- **TypeScript and Type-Safe Coding**: Using TypeScript has increased my understanding of statically typed languages in the JavaScript ecosystem. I have become familiar with type annotations, interfaces, type inference, function type annotations, and tsconfig.json to ensure type-safety throughout my applications. By making use of TypeScript's compiler and advanced type-checking features, I've been able to catch potential bugs early and streamline the refactoring process. This approach to coding has made my applications more maintainable and helped cultivate the habit of writing self-documenting and predictable code.
- **jQuery and Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Utilizing jQuery has increased my understanding of dynamic web interactions through the use of JavaScript. I have become proficient in selecting and manipulating DOM elements and handling events. By using the jQuery framework, I was able to rapidly develop an interactive user interface on my web applications. This framework facilitated a smoother workflow for me and allowed for quick prototyping and iteration. Future directions include introducing animations and making AJAX calls to grant users access to hundreds of questions from Trivia databases.
